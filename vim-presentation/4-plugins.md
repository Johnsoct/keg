# Plugins!

Finally, right? 

First, there are a **lot** of plugins for vim, and don't even consider comparing it to the number of plugins for Neovim (benefit of being written in Lua).

## How do they work? 

Via a plugin manager, which I recommend [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). 

Install plugins are loaded when Vim loads and enables additional functionality through `:commands`, which can be keymapped.

## Example!

Instead of walking through installing it (it's very easy), I'll just show you my config, keymaps I utilizing plugins, and we'll install a plugin.
